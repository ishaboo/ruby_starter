## To Do list

### List of remaining tasks:

* [ ] A map in ASCII --> Done
* [ ] A bot to interact with

### Deal with adding a shop and shopkeepers

Check out some other MUDs to see how shops and NPCs are handled there.

Buying method is sorta working, needs adjustments.

Also gonna add a shopkeeper...

### RSpecs

RSpecs as of now do not really make that much sense, how and when could they be helpful for this project?

### Bots

Ideas to build bots...

Would be nice to make pets more available, also talking to bots and giving weapons some kind of additional damage bonus would be good.

Adding maptiles into a single map and inventory_items into a single inventory is also an idea.

Adding a alive true or bad column to the bot, pet and character models sounds like a good idea too.

### Achievements

Got the help menues cleaned, now it would be nice to move other output from controllers to views.

Still need a shopkeeper...

### Need a method or some way to get money

Maybe add some coins to Bots, or a way to earn it...

Another idea would be a massive map expansion with places that hide things and coins

A sell option within a shop would also be good

* Now Bots have items and money, create a method, or add to the grab command a way to pick up dead Bots stuff... maybe steal it if thief is a skill...

Add pets...

### Methods that are needed!!!

A helper method to find if two models are on the same maptile... something general, like 'same_tile'

A method to grab items from dead bots... --> got a method to grab stuff, need a route now.

Routes need to be cleaned.


### Seed adjustments

Need to create an inventory and add items, weapons and coins to it.

Weapons have damage which should be taken into account when fighting, in addition to special skills.


### Ideas to manage skills

When discipline warrior is chosen weapon damage is upped by 10 percent per point on that discipline.

Disciplines can have points from 1 through 10
